# Credit Risk Model Scorecard

## 📊 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a credit risk model scorecard using machine learning techniques. The scorecard will help in evaluating the creditworthiness of loan applicants by analyzing various features related to their financial behavior and history.

## 📂 Data Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains information about loan applicants, including their demographic details, financial history, and loan status. The dataset is essential for training and validating the credit risk model.

### 📝 Dataset Description
- **Loan Data**: The dataset includes various features such as:
  - 👤 Applicant demographics (age, income, etc.)
  - 💵 Loan details (amount, term, interest rate)
  - 📉 Financial history (previous defaults, repayment history)
  - 🏠 Home ownership status
  - ⚙️ Other relevant attributes

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - 🛠️ Handle missing values and outliers.
   - 🔄 Encode categorical variables.
   - 📏 Normalize or standardize numerical features as necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - 📊 Visualize distributions of key features.
   - 🔗 Analyze correlations between features and the target variable.

3. **Model Development**:
   - 📚 Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - 🤖 Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) to build predictive models.
   - 📈 Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

4. **Scorecard Development**:
   - 📝 Convert the model output into a scorecard format.
   - 🎯 Assign points to different ranges of predictor variables based on their impact on the probability of default.

5. **Validation**:
   - ✅ Validate the scorecard using the test dataset.
   - 🏦 Ensure that the scorecard meets business requirements and regulatory standards.
